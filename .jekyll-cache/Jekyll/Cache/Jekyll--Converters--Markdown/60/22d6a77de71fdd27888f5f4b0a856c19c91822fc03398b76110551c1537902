I"Q<h2 id="image-modal-include">Image Modal Include</h2>

<p>The image modal allows you to display a small image, which then opens a large image in an image modal.</p>

<p>The include needs the ratio, link, alt and large link.</p>

<p>The ratios are Bulma image classes. The link is the path to the thumbnail image, the large_link is the path to the large image.</p>

<p>Below is an example for the include.</p>

<p><code>
{% include image-modal.html ratio="is-16by9" link="https://via.placeholder.com/400x225" alt="Example image" large_link="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x675" %}
</code></p>
